     <!-- Info
     	This website has been created having done research online, whereby I was able to find tools and resources to help create the website. It includes styles such as fonts that were outsourced, with the link available in the CSS page. Other CSS pages such as animate.css, boostrap.css, bootstrap.min.css, owl.carousel.css, owl.theme and responsive.css have elements that were outsourced with references to their original authors indicated within the pages to avoid copyright. Most of which are open source projects. Github is a key resource used and seen throughout the website. The style.css page is the primary styling element used within this, which also includes many of my adjustments to produce a site that has matching styling to meet the house style and design requirements I had set in order to be a personal portfolio. 

     	Emphasis has been set upon the company I currently work at, being Sirenum, to further add information relevant to me. Once I build enough resources that would be suitable as an indication of myself, I shall later add this to increase the ratio of information presented to lean more towards myself. I.e. will add more information about me as time progresses. -->

    <!-- Navigation
    ==========================================-->
    <!-- Here I have set the headings to include labels that navigates the user to different section of the website. It scrolls down rather than opening a new page, since I wanted all of the content to be displayed on a single page. This assists with the design I wanted to set and helps to organise the content better. The labels have the 'page-scroll' class attached to ensure they all have the same formatting to ensure they match the house style. Additionally, this is set to collapse so that more screen real-estate can be used to display more of the selected section. It will only collapse a small amount so that the buttons are still available for the user to select.-->

    ==========================================-->
    <!-- This is the home page for my website. The site has been created so that all of the information will be displayed on one page rather than having multiple page for each section. This enabled me to have a flow throughout the website as the page slides from one section to the next. I used the 'tf-home' and 'overlay' class to set the brackground, add filter and set the height. The 'content' class sets the position and padding. Since the site contains significant information on Sirenum, I noted this within the Title of the site seen as 'Sirenum Edition'. The 'strong' element has been used to make the specific text bold, enabling it to stand out. -->

    <!-- In this section I have included the image I created for Unit 30. One of which is a self-portrait of myself and the other is an image of my office. Additionally, I have numerous classes throughout each section such as the 'clearfix' class for the paragraphs and 'img-responsive' class for the images. This is so that I could set a standard format for each object in the website, ensuring consistency throughout. It also makes it easier to apply a set of formatting to it without having to type it in every time time it is needed. I can just refer to the class which will automatically apply the conditions I need. I set this section up so that the image will be on the left whilst the text is on the right. I've split the content up using breaks, divs, img and paragraphs. Since the theme of my website is black and white, I ensured the contents in this section matched it, in terms of fonts, colour and images.-->

                        </p>
                        <br>
                        <p>
                            Sir George Monoux, the founder of the Grammar School (later College), was born in or before 1465. In 1506 he was a Warden of the Drapers Company, in 1509 he became the Sheriff of London and later in 1514 he became Lord Mayor. Sir George Monoux was elected to Parliament as a Burgess for the City in 1523. He was a wealthy man who spent much of his time in Walthamstow.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            George Monoux (alderman of London and local worthy) erected the Almshouses, associated school and feast ball for the poor of Walthamstow on a former parcel of St. Mary's Churchyard in 1527 in Walthamstow Village. The Monoux School operated there for 353 years until moving firstly to West Avenue then to High Street, and finally to Chingford Road in 1927. The western end was rebuilt in 1955 following bombing in October 1940.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            From 1527 to 1999 the school underwent many changes. From 1659 to 1968 it operated as a grammar school for boys. From 1968 to 1986 the school was a comprehensive, and in the late 1960s, it was ranked as the 11th best state school in the country. In 1986 the school became a sixth form college and girls were admitted for the first time. In 1993, Monoux became an Incorporated College, which it remains today.
